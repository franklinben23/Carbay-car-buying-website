> This is a capstone project for the HTML and CSS section of the Technical Skills Curriculum.

A capstone project is the closing project that students will solo-perform. Its goal is to assess the student's technical and professional skills from the course that it is closing. For this project, the student should develop a concept, responsive, mobile-first web page.

## Design Considerations

ThIs website was build with the purpose of Tackling one area of e-commerce Usually not known for it's appeal to design: Car Buying sites. Using a relaxed color palette and a clean and minimallistic design approach we intend to give any potential vehicle purchaser an easy, straighforward, and stress-free buying experience.

- The page is divided into sections, where any user can easily identify the type of vehicle It is looking for.
- below the Header there is a card displaying a recent offer, not displayed in small screens.
- upon hitting search, The user will be taken to a site where he can further distill the search results.
